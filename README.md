# MakeSPPHackathon-GoGreen
MakeSPP Hackathon Go Green Group Project

Overview: A three-day virtual hackathon for high schoolers. 

Purpose: With my group, we submitted our website to the environmental studies category. In our website, Go Green, we highlighted information regarding to sustanibility and climate change. 

By creating a navigation bar, along with an adventure-styled personality quiz about how eco-friendly the user is, we were able to expand on our coding skills.

Additionally, we linked our sources to further encourage users to learn more about living an eco-friendly lifestyle. We also included tips for users to make the world
greener. 

This website was completely coded in HTML, CSS, and Javascript.
