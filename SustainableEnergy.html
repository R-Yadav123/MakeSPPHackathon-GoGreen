    <p>
    Sustainable energy is a great way to preserve the environment. Solar energy and wind energy are great ways to do so.  
    </p>
    <h3 class = "solar">Solar Energy</h3>
    <p>
      Humans have been harnessing solar energy for thousands of years. <br>
      Energy from the sun is used to grow crops, stay warm, power devices, and so much more! <br>
      Did you know that more energy from the sun falls on the earth in one hour than is used <br>
      by everyone in the world in one year? Solar energy systems donâ€™t produce air pollutants or <br>
      greenhouse gases, and as long as they are responsibly handled, most solar panels have few <br>
      environmental impacts beyond the manufacturing process.
    </p>
  
    <br>
     <h3 class = "wind">Wind Energy</h3>
    <p>
      You may be wondering why you felt a breeze of air pass you on a windy day. The effect on wind is the <br>
      unbalanced heating on Earth's atmosphere. In addition, Earth rotating on its axis is also the cause of <br>
      wind. Wind turbines or windmills take all of the energy in wind and turn it into electricity. How cool <br>
      is that?
